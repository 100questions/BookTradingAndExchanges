#  Software and smart app developing project
## Introduction

Hi! I'm **Pham Dangtruong** and my nickname is **Eric pham**.This is a course project that was developed by me and my co-worker ,**Tran Quang Loc**. Project is about the application based on **C# Programing language** and **Asp.Net Framework**, **OnlineBookStoreManagerment**. We create an API using **C#** as well and **Database first method**. The API was deployed on Azure cloud. We use it throught out the project. We use **Visual studio 2019** and **Sql server 2012** to develop this project. The following step below we will guide you how to configure this app.

## First, Deploy API to Azure clould
If you have an azure account. Let's Move on the [Database](https://github.com/100questions/BookTradingAndExchanges/tree/develop/Database "Database") folder to run the script to generate database. Then go to the **[BookStoreServices](https://github.com/100questions/BookTradingAndExchanges/tree/develop/BookStoreServices "BookStoreServices")** folder to run the project inside. After that you have to configure the data model to make sure the app run properly. On top of that, Watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GOizxTNLjg&t=244s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GOizxTNLjg&t=244s) to deploy project to azure and enjoy the resuzlt. And one thing you have to consider that let's turn on **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** on **Firewall settings tab** of database. If you don't have account let's register one because it's free. If not you can deploy it on local IIS server.
